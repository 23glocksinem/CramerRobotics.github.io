Things that need to be done! :)

* create a contact page
* create a sponsors page
* create a gallery page
* create a robots and awards page
* pick out some cool fonts for the website

Home Page:
* make your gallery significantly smaller or make it slightly smaller and resize the images
* change navbar dimensions so the poor bounty hunter isn't squished
* add in info about the program, who we are, and what we do
