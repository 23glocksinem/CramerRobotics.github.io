            <h1>Who are we?</h1>
            <p>We are the E-Ville Bounty Hunters, Team 14623 based in Essexville, Michigan. This season was our team's rookie season. The students on the team all attend Cramer Junior High School and work countless hours to improve and perfect the robot with help from mentors. The program is non-profit and is made entirely to help give students an idea of what there is to offer in the STEM field. We look forward to many more years of competition to kick some nuts and bolts!</p>
